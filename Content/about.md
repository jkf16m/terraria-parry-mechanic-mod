This folder contains subfolders, for each feature of the mod.

The Main folder, contains the principal feature of the entire mod, without it, nothing has any meaning.
Naturally, the Main feature of the mod, must not have a feature flag.

Every other folder, MUST HAVE a feature flag, that can be enabled or disabled, on the GameplayModConfig, or
whichever Server Side Mod Config that exists that has it.
