--- Parry mechanic ---

///Current features:///

[Parry]
- The main mechanic of the mod
- Assign the parry button to any of your liking
- After parrying an enemy, depending on your accuracy, the delay will be more or less.

///Critical Zenith (Experimental feature)///
- Some weird idea I'm working on, not sure if it will stay or not, but for now I like it.
- After parrying an enemy, you will enter into a "Heightened" state, and if you're able to dodge enemies and positioning yourself without needing to parry... You will have a small opportunity to deal a Critical Zenith hit!!
- This special critical hit, deals the damage of your weapon + a huge percentage of health from the enemy, but it is difficult to pull it off.
- If your parry is poorly-timed, you will not be able to perform it.
- You will lose your "focus" or "Heightened Senses" once you either:
-- Get hit once
-- Hit an enemy before the critical zenith time window
-- Parry an enemy

----------------------------------------

[Working on]
- Overall code refactoring
- Multiplayer support (I have no idea how client-server communication works on TModLoader, but I have a simple example implemented on this mod.
    Of course, I have no idea if it is correctly implemented or not.)
