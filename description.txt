Parry mechanic.

Current features:

# Parry:
-- The main mechanic of the mod
-- Assign the parry button to any of your liking
-- After parrying an enemy, depending on your accuracy, the delay will be more or less.
# Critical Zenith (Experimental feature):
-- Some weird idea I'm working on, not sure if it will stay or not, but for now I like it.
-- After parrying an enemy, you will enter into a "Heightened" state, and if you're able to dodge enemies and positioning
  yourself without needing to parry... You will have a small opportunity to deal a Critical Zenith hit!!
-- This special critical hit, deals the damage of your weapon + a huge percentage of health from the enemy, but it is difficult to pull it off.
-- You will lose your "focus" or "Heightened Senses" once you either:
---- Get hit once
---- Hit an enemy before the critical zenith time window
---- Parry an enemy
-- If your parry is poorly-timed, you will not be able to perform it.

Working on:
# Overall code refactoring:
-- This is my first mod on TModLoader
# Multiplayer support:
-- I have no idea how client-server communication works on TModLoader, but I have a simple example implemented on this mod.
    Of course, I have no idea if it is correctly implemented or not.
